DATA
#Illumina paired end reads supplied as <two-character prefix> <fragment mean> <fragment stdev> <forward_reads> <reverse_reads>
#if single-end, do not specify <reverse_reads>
#If mean/stdev are unknown use 500 and 50 -- these are safe values that will work for most runs
#MUST HAVE Illumina paired end reads to use MaSuRCA
